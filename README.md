### Description of the dataset

The dataset contains 9 different seafood types. For each class, there are 1000 augmented images and their pair-wise augmented ground truths.
Each class can be found in the "Fish_Dataset" file with their ground truth labels. All images for each class are ordered from "00000.png" to "01000.png".

For example, if you want to access the ground truth images of the shrimp in the dataset, the order should be followed is "Fish->Shrimp->Shrimp GT".
